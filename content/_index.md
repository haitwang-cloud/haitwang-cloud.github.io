üéØ About Me: Over the past year, I have remained actively engaged in the open-source community, primarily contributing to cloud-native, Kubernetes, and AI infrastructure projects. My work spans reporting and resolving complex bugs in production environments, proposing and implementing new features for GPU scheduling and observability, and improving deployment documentation for large-scale AI serving frameworks such as vLLM. I have also helped refine workflows, provided troubleshooting for GPU operators, and advocated for enhancements to better support enterprise requirements in hybrid cloud clusters. My efforts reflect a deep commitment to improving reliability, scalability, and user experience in modern infrastructure systems.
